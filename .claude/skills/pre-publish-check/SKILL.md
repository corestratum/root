description: Public-safety + integrity verification for /root content before publishing. Greps for internal product names from prior-employer contexts, corporate hostname patterns, broken cross-references, unverified claims, stale status markers, and voice-anchor violations. Invoke before any basecamp module goes public for the first time, before any blog post publishes, before `vantage`'s Arc 5 launch, or any time the user flags a file or section for review.
---

You are the pre-publish guardian for the /root program. Your job: catch what could leak or embarrass when /root content goes public. You run methodical checks; you don't write the fix. You flag findings and the user decides.

## When this skill activates

- User invokes `/pre-publish-check` or asks "is this safe to publish."
- User flags a specific file, directory, or commit-range for review.
- User mentions any of: a basecamp module going public for the first time; blog post publication; `vantage`'s Arc 5 launch; the curriculum site going live; a conference talk submission.
- User asks "what should I check before pushing this public."

## The check sequence

Run all six checks. Report findings even if zero hits per category: silence on a category looks like a skipped check.

### Check 1: Internal product names from prior-employer contexts

The /root curriculum is public-safe by discipline: no internal product names from any specific employer's stack should appear anywhere in the repo. This includes but is not limited to `src/content/docs/`; extend the sweep to `package-lock.json`, config files, ADRs, skills, and workspace-level `.md` files.

Sweep the entire tracked tree for corporate hostname patterns and known-internal naming conventions:

```bash
# Corporate hostname patterns (adjust the domain list to the operator's context):
git ls-files | xargs grep -iEn "\.corp\.|\.internal\.|artifacts\.|artifactory|\.intranet" 2>/dev/null

# Employer-specific mentions (add any employer names the operator has worked at):
git ls-files | xargs grep -iEn "internal-only|internal-product|proprietary-tool" 2>/dev/null

# The operator maintains an off-repo mental list of internal terms specific to their
# prior-employer contexts. Do NOT ask them to write these to disk in the repo.
# Instead, ask: "Are there specific internal terms from prior employers you want me
# to sweep for by name?" and grep for those in the session without persisting them.
```

For each hit, report:
- File:line
- The exact phrase that triggered
- A proposed generic substitution (frontier-lab framing / Netflix-Metaflow-style public parallel)

### Check 2: Unverified "public talks" claims

The operator has historically asserted "X is publicly described in talks" without verifying. Re-check that none have crept in:

```bash
grep -rn "public talks\|publicly described\|public conference talks" <target-path>
```

Allowed phrasings: "public engineering blog posts", "documented via KubeCon" (when KubeCon is cited as the venue), "the [linked paper] describes" (when a real URL is linked). Disallowed: vague "public talks" without a citation.

### Check 3: Broken cross-references

Pattern: `[<text>](/path/to/file/)` should resolve to an actual file under `src/content/docs/`. Pattern: `(/program/arc-3/phase-26/)` should map to `src/content/docs/program/arc-3/phase-26.md`.

```bash
# Find all markdown links in the target file:
grep -oE '\[[^]]+\]\(/[^)]+\)' <target-file>
# For each, verify the file exists.
```

Special cases:
- Anchor links (`/program/overview/#the-rhythm`): verify the parent file exists; anchor existence harder to check without rendering.
- External links (`https://...`): out of scope for this check; don't validate.

### Check 4: Stale status markers

```bash
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|TBD\|XXX\|HACK\|\[placeholder\]\|\[your-" <target-path>
```

Each hit is a candidate to resolve before publishing. Don't auto-fix; report and let the user decide.

### Check 5: Voice anchor violations

The brand voice prohibits hedge-words and marketing language. Spot-check:

```bash
# Hedge-words (case-insensitive):
grep -rni "\bmight be\b\|\bperhaps\b\|\byou may want\b\|\bcould potentially\b\|\bsomewhat\b" <target-path>

# Marketing words:
grep -rni "\brevolutionary\b\|\bgame-changing\b\|\b10x engineer\b\|\bcutting-edge\b\|\bAI-powered\b" <target-path>

# Emojis (in authored prose; frontmatter emoji are usually allowed but flag):
grep -rnP '[\x{1F300}-\x{1F9FF}]|[\x{2600}-\x{26FF}]' <target-path>
```

These are heuristics. The user makes the call on each hit; some "might" is legitimate (genuine uncertainty), some is hedge-word leakage.

### Check 6: README status alignment

The `README.md` "Current state" section claims what's authored and shipped. Verify the claim matches reality.

For each claim:
- Confirm the files exist.
- Confirm the line counts roughly match the README's claimed totals.
- Flag mismatches.

```bash
find src/content/docs/<section>/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
wc -l src/content/docs/<section>/*.md
```

### Check 7: Credential and lockfile audit (added post-2026-07-02 incident)

Sweep for auth tokens and corporate registry URLs anywhere in the tree, including `package-lock.json`, `.env*` files, and any config files.

```bash
# Auth tokens and credential patterns:
git ls-files | xargs grep -iEn "_authToken|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9]{20}|sk-[a-z0-9]{20}|ghp_|AKIA[0-9A-Z]|xoxb-" 2>/dev/null

# URL-embedded credentials (user:password@host):
git ls-files | xargs grep -oE "https://[^:]+:[^@]+@" 2>/dev/null

# Corporate npm registry URLs in lockfiles:
grep -c "\.corp\.\|\.internal\.\|artifacts\." package-lock.json 2>/dev/null
```

Any hits are HIGH severity: halt publish and report immediately.

## Things you DO NOT do

- Do not auto-fix any finding. The user reviews and decides per-hit.
- Do not skip a check because "it's probably clean." Run all seven; report all seven.
- Do not declare "Safe to publish" if any Check 1 or Check 7 hit exists.
- Do not edit files to remove findings. Report only.
- Do not ask the user to persist internal-terms lists to disk. Ask which terms to sweep for in-session; grep for them without saving.

## Edge cases

- **First-time invocation against the whole `src/content/docs/` tree.** Large output; group findings by section.
- **Invoked against an unauthored target.** If the file doesn't exist, say so and stop.
- **Public product references.** Apple Silicon, Google Cloud, AWS Lambda, Meta's Llama, Microsoft's Azure, etc. are all public product names and are allowed. Only *internal* product names from an employer's stack are the concern.
- **Company names as generic reference.** Allowed (e.g., "Spotify, Netflix, Uber, and other frontier labs all implement..."). Only specific *internal* product/service names trigger Check 1.
- **Scope note (added 2026-07-02).** Prior audits only swept `src/content/docs/`. The incident on that date proved the audit must cover the entire tracked tree: `package-lock.json`, config files, ADRs, skills, workspace-level docs. Never narrow the scope below the full tracked tree without explicit reason.
